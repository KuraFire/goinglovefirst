title: Love First Friend
excerpt: I am here to support you, without shame, blame, or judgement.

As a [Love First Person](/about/faruk/love-first-person), I can redefine every part of my identity as I desire. It means I get to ask myself questions that challenge what my identity is, what identity even means, and redefine those ideas beyond the constraints of our societal norms and expectations. I get to invent my future self, rewrite my story of the past, and live harmoniously in the present.

While there is much more to be defined for this, I want you to know:

### I Am Here For You

<pre>
            I am Here For You

       If you ever need to unload, or

dump your thoughts on someone, I’m here for you.

I will not judge, shame, or blame you for anything

you share, and I will let you know if I don't have

the spoons to receive it in that exact moment.

Sharing your fears, your pain, or even

your shame, will make you stronger.

You will say <q><em>“I no longer want

this to have power over me”</em></q>

and feel its power fade.

Your LF friend,

Faruk

❤️
