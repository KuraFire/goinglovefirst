title: "Love First Person"
---




<pre>
I am a person,
<a href="/about/faruk">Whole and complete</a>,
Worthy of love and belonging.
With <a href="#asfat">goals</a> and <a href="#asfat">dreams</a>, and a desire
to make <a href="#asfat">a positive difference</a> in the world.
I have <a href="/i-have-the-answer#asfat">my own answers</a>, but I will <a href="#asfat">need your help</a>.

I am a person, and this is my foundation.
A blank canvas upon which for me to paint
All that I am, and all I want to become.
A canvas built from the footsteps of my past;
A person <a href="/reboot">rebooted</a> anew in the present;
A story I can write for my future.

One of infinite stories of people,
Ours to write for a world
made with love.
</pre>
