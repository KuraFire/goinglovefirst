title: "Love First Person"
---


I am a person,
[Whole and complete](/about/faruk/),
Worthy of love and belonging.
With [goals](#asfat) and [dreams](#asfat) to make [a positive difference](#asfat).
I have [my own answers](/i-have-the-answer#asfat), and a desire to [contribute](#asfat).


I am a person,
And this is my foundation.
A blank canvas upon which for me to paint
All that I am, and all that I still want to be.
A canvas built from the footsteps of my past,
A person [rebooted](/reboot) in the present,
A story I get to write for my future,

One of an infinite story of people,
Ours to write for a new world.

Made with love.
