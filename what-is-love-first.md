<!-- what is it? -->
Hello, and: welcome everyone! <nobr>Love First</nobr> is a way of life. A movement. A shared identity for people who want to build bridges <del>for a sustainable and inclusive</del><ins>to a</ins> future for all of us: a world made with love.
<!-- Hint for those looking under the hood: what might the meaning of a colon be? -->



<!-- why do we need it? -->
All across the planet countless people are creating holistic, sustainable, and fairer solutions for the myriad challenges we face: from local neighborhood crises to global threats like climate change and, presently, the coronavirus pandemic. Their efforts make important, even life-saving differences in millions of people’s lives, but throughout all the good will and work there is a more powerful message to the world that remains largely unspoken. It is an undercurrent of harmony, present and discernible in the words and deeds of so many, yet rarely pointed out for its true value to us as a society.

Love First seeks to put words to that message, with your help and participation. That undercurrent is a declaration of love, an expression of it, aimed at all of humanity. It is a message sent with profound conviction and commitment, saying:

<!--  Our Message Of Love: -->
- We are all one: a citizen of the world, each of us equally worthy of love and belonging;
- We care about all people, regardless of our differences, because we are all connected in this precious life;
- We deserve to live in a healthy environment, with clean air and water and oceans free of pollution or trash, and we demand from our leaders a sustainable economy, one that fundamentally and demonstrably prioritizes the safety and well-being of people and nature over materials, wealth, and power;
- We believe the time for “us versus them” is behind us, that now has begun the era for “us all versus the problem”;
- We are willing to change and evolve ourselves—including making concessions, compromises, even sacrifices if needed—in a conscious effort to demonstrate our commitment;
- We commit to:
  - Start using the tools of love and sustainability to build tomorrow’s society, instead of  using the tools of shame and judgement that pervade the world of today;
  - Start elevating each other through new or evolved practices, and make them accessible to anyone in their daily lives, instead of deriving pleasure or value from things that harm other people (whether for entertainment or profit);

### Love First is personal

Ultimately, “what <nobr>Love First</nobr> is” depends on you as much as it does on me. It is not any one specific “thing” because <a href="/love-first-is/"><nobr>Love First</nobr> is an idea</a>, and ideas are but a whisper of pure possibility.

For me, that idea was that there exists a pattern or structure to love that can be practiced, taught, and replicated—and when used, yields the best possible outcomes for us all. And this pattern included using our most valuable tool in history, our stories, to aid both our personal development—our growth, our _conscious evolution_—and our connection with others, at a time where greater understanding of one another is most needed. It represented a way to bridge the divides across ideologies, across our differences, across the whole of humanity. For me, all of that felt like love itself trying to reach out to us, and reveal its true identity. For me, it is the belief that the right message and the right story of love can grow anyone’s heart to become bigger than they themselves thought possible. For me, it is the art form I choose to express myself with, and the lens through which I examine myself and the world around me.

For you, it could be that <nobr>Love First</nobr> means something different entirely. The greatest value or meaning you get from it does not need to match mine, and because it is intrinsically meant to be a collectively collaborative creation <del>(I love alliteration, but _dang_)</del> you can contribute what it means to you and make it better.

Collaborative art as a philosophy; a lifelong practice to create a story told by all of us.


<!-- The mission of Love First is to harmonize and magnify the invaluable work of all the people envisioning and creating a new world, and build it on foundations of love. It is to contribute the knowledge, teachings, and best practices of Love First to further the efficacy and success. through a collection of strategies, solutions, and best practices, in hopes of enlisting and aligning more and more people in the work to build a world wherein people, societies, and the environment all thrive.
