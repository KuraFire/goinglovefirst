<!-- What: -->
### What is <nobr>Love First</nobr>?

Hello,
and:
Welcome everyone! <nobr>Love First</nobr> is a way of being, with a shared identity that connects the people building a brighter, lasting future for all of us: a world made with love, _first_.

<!--
For those looking under the hood:

Welcome to a new dimension to the story.
-->

Love<!--,
--> First:
          something exciting that
                                  [**I Want To Convince You**](/be-convincing#asfat)
 of.

<!-- Then: -->
### What is <nobr><em>Going</em></nobr> Love First?
_“Going Love First”_ is:
- an unanswered question, for now. Sorry. (Truly.)


<!-- NeXT: -->
### What is Going <nobr><em>on with</em></nobr> Love First?

Love First has been in multidimensional development for **2.4.27 cycles** (give or take a day).

All iterations prior to [Reboot](/reboot) are currently considered _Legacy:_ alpha and beta tests with limited release.


<!-- Finally: -->
### Love First is
Love First is [an idea](/love-first-is/idea#asfat). Like a seed, this idea can grow into a sapling and, with the right support, become a little tree: strong enough to stand on its own, slowly breathing life into our world. With enough time and nourishment, given enough _love_, this idea can grow new branches of its story, opening up new realms of possibility.
