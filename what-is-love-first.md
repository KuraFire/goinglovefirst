<!-- what is it? -->
Hello, and: welcome everyone! <nobr>Love First</nobr> is a way of being, with a shared identity that connects the people building a brighter, lasting future for all of us: a world made with love, _first_.
<!-- Hint for those looking under the hood: what might the meaning of a colon be? -->

Love First is [an idea](/love-first-is/idea#asfat). Like a seed, this idea can grow into a sapling and, with the right support, become a little tree: strong enough to stand on its own, slowly breathing life into our world. With enough time and nourishment, given enough _love_, this idea can grow new branches of its story, opening up new realms of possibility.

Realms, some of which we’ve yet to see discovered:

- [A Framework For Personal Development](/love-first-is/personal-development)

These are some of the things that <nobr>Love First</nobr> _can become_. But only with [your support on Patreon](https://patreon.com/lovefirst).
