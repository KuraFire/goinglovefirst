Our principles are the foundations of our ways of being. They underpin the personal values, beliefs, and behaviors that define our unique inner layer of identity.


> Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life.
<cite><em>Principles</em>, by Ray Dalio</cite>

The principles use active voice so you can clearly see how to apply them in your life. They are specific, allowing you to focus on one at a time if necessary. They donâ€™t require academic knowledge or special training, making them easy and accessible for everyone to benefit from. Lastly, they are not prescriptive, so wield them gracefully however much you want.

## The Elemental Principles
The first five principles are the core foundations upon which Love First builds, and correspond to the classic elements: heart, water, fire, air, and earth.
