Spinel at the end: finding new love; every time you see another dimension to what love is, it feels like discovering falling in love for the first time.


## Why Christians & Conservatives Should Watch Steven Universe

Because Steven is basically a modern version of Jesus Christ. Because what if not Jesus himself, but the _idea_ of Jesus, gets reborn every few hundred years?

(We’ll make a secret pact: we’ll say we’ve changed, but deep down inside we're only doing it to prove that we were right after all!)



I'm watching lots of Steven Universe because my last time seeing J was our final date before the quarantine started. We cooked dinner, watched the movie together, and had wonderfully connected sex. We never spoke about this, but for me it felt like we both knew this might be our last time seeing each other for a long time.

Ever since, I've been rewatching the show and the movie. It's keeping a connection with her alive that I'm afraid of losing. Which might also be the case for her, given how hurt she was by me saying I didn't know if I wanted to keep watching SU together, when I thought I needed distance.
