### What Love First is for me
For me it is a way of life: a daily practice of trying to align myself to love, of channeling my actions through a holistic lens of love. It’s about creating a conscious hero’s journey with my life, cultivating my own unique identity while simultaneously saying: _I am one with humanity, and we are all one together, connected to each other, each of us worthy of love and belonging no matter who we are._ It’s saying <q>“the salvation of mankind is through love and in love”</q>[^1], recognizing that love is available to us at all times if we open ourselves up to it (and own our actions where needed), and that we can receive its bliss no matter how dire our circumstances are.

But Love First is also a mentality or mindset to me, a way of looking at and understanding the world that has given me enormous emotional strength, stability, and resilience; it has reduced my stress and anxiety down to almost nothing despite the increasingly scary times we live in. It has been the foundation for all my greatest connections with the people in my life, from relationship partners and lovers to friends and even complete strangers who have reached out to me in support.

#### Ask For What You Want  
I want to turn everything I know and have learned over the two years of research and practices of Love First so far into useful, valuable, and _effective_ courses that I can teach other people, to help and <a href="https://lovefirstcoaching.com">coach them</a> in some or many aspects of their life.

I also want to offer my insight, models, and strategies as a consulting service to those who wish to further align their projects or businesses to this holistic view of love, and create a sustainable future that works for all of us. (And I would not just bring my Love First knowledge and skills, but also my decades of experience in other areas, like technology, design, community, and events.)

<!-- I want to continue going through the works and teachings of leaders and experts across a wide range of fields and backgrounds, and synthesize the best elements together to create more meaning, cultivate more understanding, and connect more deeply.

And eventually, I want to create tools—products, apps, platforms—to help people learn and develop their skills in life. But that’s a long ways into the future, perhaps. -->

For any of that[^2], I need help! Maybe yours, maybe someone you know. This can range from as little as occasionally reading a working draft and giving feedback to as significant as becoming my business partner in Love First entirely.

### What could Love First be for you?
So far, I’ve used the foundations of Love First to work with other people on their projects and “fill the gaps with love,” so to speak. I’m putting more universal and actionable structure to those practices now, in order to turn it into a consulting offer. But to refine and improve it, and get it to that state with a successful track record to give it sufficient credibility, I’m eager to apply it to any project or effort in whatever collaborative, mutually-beneficial way works for you.
