**What is Love First to me?**  
For me it is a way of life: a daily practice of trying to align myself to love, of channeling my actions through a holistic lens of love. It’s creating a conscious hero’s journey with your life, cultivating your own unique identity while simultaneously saying: I am one with humanity, and we are all one together, connected to each other in life, worthy of love and belonging no matter who we are. It is saying that “the salvation of mankind is through love and in love”[^1].

**What should Love First be to you?**
