3. **Vouch for me:**
### Write a “Letter For Love”

Publish something to your preferred social media platform, vouching for me as a person whom people should support, and why.

This can be as simple and broad as “I’ve worked with Faruk, he was cool and I want him to succeed,” to the highly specific: “Faruk wrote something that perfectly expressed or catered to my wants/needs/desires, and I believe he’ll do the same for you one day. His Love First reboot looks intriguing; I’m not quite sure I fully get it yet, but I love what he’s been doing so far and I have a feeling it’s going to be something really special. So check it out!”
