title: Today Is A Weekend Day For Me
---

I do a thing, sometimes in the morning. I say to myself: 

## Today Is A Weekend Day For Me

I chose to make these words mean that: Today, I'm allowed to do work and feel stressed about income or whatever "thing" I'm trying to do, but at any point I can say: okay, that's enough work for today. _I_ have been enough for today.

It's saying: I know I still have something I committed to doing today, but _Today Is A Weekend Day For Me_.

There will always be tomorro–wait… let me reframe that:

_And as long as we keep fighting with love to make a different, better world,_ there will always be tomorrow.

I say that in the morning on the days I decide are weekends—not the days that the calendar decides—but I find it a helpful system _most_ of the time.

I say that in the morning when I wake up, or after breakfast, or at 11:59 AM just to make sure I still catch _morning_.

And some times…

Sometimes I say that at 11:34 PM on the Saturday, and write<!-- . --> This <!-- is the fourth puzzle --> piece. And publish that, instead of the daily story that I had committed to publishing every day.


<!-- And I will ask Matthew, as hint 3: "Is today a weekend day for you?"

part of the piece is on the github commit, as a comment. -->
