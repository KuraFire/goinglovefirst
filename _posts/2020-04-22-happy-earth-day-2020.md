Happy Earth Day 2020!

I know it’s hard to celebrate something that feels more out of reach than ever before, for most of us. Let’s do it anyway!

I came to this earth many, many decades in the future, but in all my years so far I have never been as grateful for Earth’s resilience, beauty, and strength.

Growing up, I rarely ever felt like I “belonged” to my nation of birth; I’ve called myself a **citizen of the world** for as long as I can remember. There is too much beauty in this pale blue dot to let arbitrary lines on maps limit our imagination for who we can be.

This pandemic is full of horrors, pain and suffering, chaos and disruption. Stability feels like a fading dream. And yet…

This is also a moment in time unprecedented. It offers us a glimpse of humanity’s potential when we come together to tackle the challenges threatening all of us.

[I hope we learn from this](#asfat).

Be safe. Stay healthy. Ask for help if you need it, and support each other best you can. We may not be in the same boats, but we are all in this ocean of stars together.

I love you ❤️🙏🏼
