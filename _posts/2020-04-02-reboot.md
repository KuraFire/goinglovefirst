## What if you could reboot the universe?

Okay, perhaps that is a tall order. You’d have to harness the power of the fourth dimension itself, in its cosmic entirety and all its infinite possibilities, _and_ figure out what a reboot would actually mean at the atomic, particle, and quantum levels. Doable, sure; just not by any of us.

So what if we started a little smaller: **what if you could reboot yourself?**

What if you took the ache in your heart, the worries in your head, and the stress in your body, and hit something like a “reset” button that lets you reinvent yourself… and redefine what it means to be a human, being?

### Everything is communication

Across how many dimensions do you communicate intentionally? How about consciously?

In 1964, Canadian communication thinker Marshall McLuhan coined the expression “[the medium is the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message),” to capture [the idea](#asfat) that the nature of _how_ something is communicated (the medium) is more important than _what_ is being communicated.

<!-- these two paragraphs will move into /everything-is/communication -->
When speech first became written, the potential lifespan of a message grew from a whispered chain of decades to however long the medium of record lasted. When radio emerged, the many layers of emotion represented in tone, pitch, and intensity could be communicated once more without words having to convey those additional dimensions. Later on, pictures would communicate a thousand words; and the advent of video added not only a visual dimension that eventually superseded reality, but also more creative configurations of speed, time, and structure for the content.
<!-- Of course, "pictures" here only refers to the photographic kind. Drawings and paintings long precede the advent of radio signals. -->

Social structures, body language, artistic and sartorial expression… the number of dimensions in which communication _occurs_ often exceeds our conscious practice of it. We say one thing with our words, and so much more through gesticulation, tone, and facial expressions. Those layers help to convey our intended emotional charge: <q>“I’m doing okay”</q> is indistinguishable from <q>“I’m doing okay”</q> in writing, but if one is said in a chipper voice and the other sighed in wistful defeat, two vastly different messages are communicated.

_The medium is the message._
<!-- Or at the very least, the medium is as important an element of the communication as the message itself. -->

Our senses give us a multi-dimensional vocabulary, but too often we think of only the big three: visual, aural, and intellectual—as in, the actual content being communicated. We don’t typically describe our messaging as being in the language of emotion, but rather as having an emotional layer or dimension to it.

Which brings me to another question for you: **how often do you communicate with your energy?**

You might say, _<q>“Faruk, I know we are made of energy, of atoms and molecules that vibrate at a certain frequency, and so we are always communicating ‘with our energy’—but that’s not a language we can learn.”</q>_

Or you might join me and say to that: _what if it was?_

### I (Don’t) Want To Change Your Mind

(unfinished)

I believe that changing our mind is one of humanity’s greatest powers—and I mean both the choice as well as the [mind-altering practice](https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/).

But I don’t want to try and change your mind here because, well, I am not interested in being prescriptivist. I am interested in putting these ideas to the test with more vigor, depth, structure, process, and documentation than I have over the past two years during which I’ve put this idea to the test on a near-daily basis. I want to formalize and demonstrate what it is like to live a life rebooted into love, communicating through more dimensions than mere voice, body, and language. I want to show that there are other ways to live, other ways of _being human_.

I only want to show you the door; it’s up to you if you want to go through it.

That said, I do want to change your heart, if yours aches like mine. Your heart is not broken, it’s fine and capable and working double time. I just want to give it the engine oil it’s been asking for.
