Universal love is the unmistakable joy radiating from within when, no matter who you are, you experience something that stirs your soul and expands your heart.

Universal love is the deepest essence of truth, provoking a feeling so pure that, even as it confronts your views or challenges your beliefs, you know in your core not to argue with it.

Universal love is the idea that broadens your understanding of the world, and gives you the courage and strength to broaden your understanding of you.

Universal love is the inclusion of all, and understanding such a world is not merely possible, but truly inevitable.

Universal love is the current that runs deep within each of us, reminding us that we are all one at the heart of this existence we call life.
