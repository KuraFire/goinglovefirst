Like air, we rarely notice the importance of possibility — until the moment we are without it.


# Believe In Possibility
## The Air Element

> We cannot create what we can't imagine.
> — Lucille Clifton

> You don’t become what you want, you become what you believe.
> ― Oprah Winfrey

> Since we cannot change reality, let us change the eyes which see reality.
> — Nikos Kazantzakis


> Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.
<cite>Philip K. Dick</cite>
